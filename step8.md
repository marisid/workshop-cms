# Step 8 - Get ready for the CMS project

```bash
git checkout step8
git merge step7
```

For the rest of the workshop your job is to build the proper CMS. We have done the front-end code for you - you only need to worry about the server side of the application.

Let's clean up unnecessary files.

**Delete the public folder**

**Keep `handler.js`, but delete all the code so that it's empty**

**Keep `server.js`, but delete all the code so that it's empty too**

## Are you sure that you have deleted the public folder?  This is really important.

If yes, then commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'enter relevant message'
git push origin step8
```
